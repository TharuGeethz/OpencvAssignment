### Description

This OpenCV project is done as an Assignment of **Image Processing and Computer Vision (SCS4116)** (University of Colombo School of Computing)
 
### Development Environment

* [OpenCV 4.0.0(Compiled Github repository code)](https://github.com/opencv/opencv)
* C++
* [QtCreator 5](https://www.qt.io/download)
* Ubuntu 16.04

### Installing Development Environment

* **OpenCV Installation**

I have used following website as my OpenCV installation guide. http://www.codebind.com/cpp-tutorial/install-opencv-ubuntu-cpp/
But I would like to make an alternative suggestion for **Step 3 â€“  Get OpenCV** Do not clone git repository for OpenCV and OpenCV-contrib instead that use below repository releases

* opencv - https://github.com/opencv/opencv/releases
* opencv_contrib - https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib/releases

Choose same release number in both links and download Source Code. Reason for this is Releases are a stable Delivery ready stable status of repositories but main repository on development stage so there is a chance that might break your build. Read more about release https://stackoverflow.com/a/33587799/2940265

* **QtCreator 5**

Installed using the Online installer from given link, which downloaded approximately over 6 GB.
